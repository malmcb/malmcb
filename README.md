# Hello world!
## My name is Mallory McBee.

- 🥇 My long term goal is to improve daily tasks and solve issues using AI and machine learning.
- 🗣️ My goal for 2022 is to hone my programming skills and contribute more to my GitHub profile!
- 📖 I am currently learning on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/malloryMcBee2114687128)

I recently finished my Master's degree in Data Science from Eastern University. You can find my capstone project on my profile publicly. Other assignments I completed are private due to university guidelines. My degree has taught me....
  - Three programming languages: Python, SQL, and R
  - Data visualization techniques using Tableau and Qlik
    - as well as visualization using Python packages Seaborn and Matplotlib
  - Machine learning techniques such as regression and classification models in Python using Scikit-learn

#### Many of my repositories are private due to University policy at Eastern. If you would like to take a look at them let me know!

In my free time, you can find me cycling around the trails in Pittsburgh 🚴‍♀️, painting at home 🖌️, or practicing photography 📸.
