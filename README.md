# Hello prospective future employers!
## My name is Mallory.
I’m interested in medicine (experience in a clinical laboratory, specifically hematology), medical marijuana, and computer science.

In my free time, you can find me cycling around the trails in Pittsburgh, painting at home, or playing video games.

I’m currently in the process of obtaining my Master's in Data Science from Eastern University.
* My studies have focused on mostly Python but I have also gotten experience using R and SQL as well.
** In python I have experience with Machine Learning algortihms, big data analysis, TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, pandas, and various other analytical and visualization packages.
