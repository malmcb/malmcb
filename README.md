# Hello prospective employers!
## My name is Mallory McBee.

I am currently a Data Scientist working in the banking industry.

I finished my Master's degree in Data Science from Eastern University at the end of 2021. You can find my capstone project on my profile publicly. Other assignments I completed are private due to university guidelines. My degree has taught me....
  - Three programming languages: Python, SQL, and R
  - Data visualization techniques using Tableau and Qlik
    - as well as visualization using Python packages Seaborn and Matplotlib
  - Machine learning techniques such as regression and classification models in Python using Scikit-learn

#### Many of my repositories are private due to University policy at Eastern. If you would like to take a look at them let me know!

In my free time, you can find me cycling around the trails in Pittsburgh üö¥‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, painting at home üñåÔ∏è, or practicing photography üì∏.
