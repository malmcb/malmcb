# Hello prospective employers!
## My name is Mallory McBee.

Currently I am working as a Medical Laboratory Scientist. I have gained almost 5 years of experience in the healthcare field since graduating with my Bachelor's in medical laboratory science from West Virginia University in 2017. As a laboratory scientist, I use problem solving skills and high attention to detail to provide the most accurate laboratory results as possible for patients in the hospital. 

- 🗣️ My goal for 2022 is to hone my programming skills and contribute more to my GitHub profile!
- 📖 I am currently learning on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/malloryMcBee2114687128)
- 💼 I am open to any opportunity to help me gain experience in the Data Science field!

I recently finished my Master's degree in Data Science from Eastern University. You can find my capstone project on my profile publicly. Other assignments I completed are private due to university guidelines, but I can grant access to anyone who asks!
  - This degree has taught me three programming languages: Python, SQL, and R
  - Data visualization techniques using Tableau and Qlik
    - as well as visualization using Python packages Seaborn and Matplotlib
  - Machine learning techniques such as regression and classification models in Python using Scikit-learn

In my free time, you can find me cycling around the trails in Pittsburgh 🚴‍♀️, painting at home 🖌️, or playing video games 🎮.
