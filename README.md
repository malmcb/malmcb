# Hello prospective future employers!
## My name is Mallory.
I’m interested in medicine (experience in a clinical laboratory, specifically hematology) and computer science.
* My goal is use these skills to better the healthcare experience for patients. 
  * In the form of evaulating data to determine risk of hospital readmission, helping develop software to make test results easier to view for every patient, or making the laboratory more streamlined with better tools for technicians to use when testing samples, or even developing software that could evaluate test results and point physicians in the right direction.

In my free time, you can find me cycling around the trails in Pittsburgh, painting at home, or playing video games.

I’m currently learning JavaScript on [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/fccd9961972-35da-4276-81f5-5b96bba00971) and in the process of obtaining my Master's in Data Science from Eastern University.
