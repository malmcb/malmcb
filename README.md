# Hello prospective employers!
## My name is Mallory McBee.

Currently I am working as a Medical Laboratory Scientist. I have gained almost 5 years of experience in the healthcare field since graduating with my Bachelor's in medical laboratory science from West Virginia University in 2017.

As a laboratory scientist, I use problem solving skills and high attention to detail to provide the most accurate laboratory results as possible for patients in the hospital. My goal is to apply these skills as well as computer programming and machine learning knowledge to analyse data in a larger scale.

I recently finished my Master's degree in Data Science from Eastern University. You can find my capstone project on my profile publicly. Other assignments I completed are private due to university guidelines, but I can grant access to anyone who asks!
  - This degree has taught me three programming languages: Python, SQL, and R
  - Data visualization techniques using Tableau and Qlik
    - as well as visualization using Python packages Seaborn and Matplotlib
  - Machine learning techniques such as regression and classification models in Python using Scikit-learn

In my free time, you can find me cycling around the trails in Pittsburgh, painting at home, or playing video games.
